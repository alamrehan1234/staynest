StayNest Mini Project

StayNest is a simplified platform for posting properties for rent, inspired by Airbnb but with a more basic set of functionalities. The project is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, demonstrating essential CRUD operations and REST API development. It allows users to list, view, update, and delete property information stored in a MongoDB database.

Key technologies used:

    EJS and EJS Mate templating engines for dynamic HTML rendering.
    Bootstrap and CSS for responsive design and clean user interface.
    Mongoose for database interaction with MongoDB.

Key Features:

    CRUD operations: Allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete property listings.
    Templating with EJS: Dynamic rendering of web pages using EJS and EJS Mate.
    MongoDB Database: Data persistence using MongoDB and Mongoose.
    Bootstrap Integration: Provides a responsive layout and UI components.
    Basic Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for user interaction with the backend.

StayNest is a mini-project demonstrating core concepts of backend development and database interaction, without all the advanced functionalities of platforms like Airbnb.
